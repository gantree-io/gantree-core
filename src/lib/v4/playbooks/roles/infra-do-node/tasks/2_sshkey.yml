# NOTE(ryan):
# Ok, so we're running this twice, the first time pretending that it works regardless of result.
# The reason for this is that this task gets run for every DO node all at once, so all the nodes
# notice the key is missing and they all try to create it, but only the first once succeeds.
# So basically part1 is a free-for-all where anyone can create the key and everyone else will fail
# For part2 everyone checks the key exists and is happy :)
# Also note, retries don't work here because the nodes will keep thinking they need to create the
# key and keep retrying and failing to create it because it already exists
